    story: `The North Pole was not merely a factory; it was a fortress of solitude and snow, governed by the heavy, rhythmic breathing of the entity known as Santa Chungus.

He stood before the Great Hearth, a figure of imposing, fluffy majesty. The red velvet suit stretched tight across his colossal frame, the gold buckle gleaming like a captive star. It was Chungusmas Eve. The sleigh—a vehicle the size of a small galleon—was packed with billions of dreams wrapped in ribbons. But as Chungus looked into the flames, the warmth did not comfort him.

It burned him.

A shiver started at the base of his spine—or where his spine would be if he weren't pure, compressed marshmallow and magic. The room tilted. The scent of pine needles vanished, replaced instantly by the stinging aroma of wet wool, mud, and unwashed fear.

Chungus blinked, and the North Pole was gone.

He was no longer a cosmic rabbit. He was standing knee-deep in freezing slush. The sky was a bruised purple, the air filled with the scream of sirens. He looked down at his hands. They were not paws. They were human, calloused, and shaking, gripping a bolt-action rifle with white-knuckled desperation.

*“Warsaw,”* he whispered, but the voice was gravel and ash. *“1944.”*

He was George Miller. He was 54 years old, and his bones felt like they were made of lead. The weight of the war pressed on his chest, a physical crushing sensation. He missed a home that had been reduced to rubble. He felt the phantom pain of a life lost to the gray tyranny of conflict. The despair was so absolute, so heavy, that Santa Chungus fell to his knees in the workshop, gasping for air that tasted of smoke.

"Master Chungus! The reindeer are restless!"

The voice snapped him back. The slush dissolved into the polished wood of the workshop floor. Chungus heaved, sweat matting his fur. "I... I am here," he rumbled.

He stumbled toward the loading bay to clear his head, but his eyes locked onto a pallet of ergonomic office chairs destined for a corporate office in Seattle.

*Click.*

His mind fractured again. The sorrow of George Miller evaporated, replaced by a manic, rattling greed. His flesh felt like it was sloughing off, leaving only cold, hard calcium. He wasn't Santa. He was the Skeleton.

He lunged at the pallet. "A fine addition," he hissed, his internal voice clacking like dry bones. "I have the ergonomic mesh... but I need the mid-century modern! My collection... it is the largest in the underworld, yet it is incomplete!"

He began frantically grabbing chairs, ignoring the toys, trying to stuff a recliner into his sack. "More seats! I must have all the places to sit, yet I have no skin to sit with!"

"B-Boss?"

Chungus spun around. Standing there, wearing a green hat with earflaps and suspenders that had seen better days, was his head elf: Chavinho.

Chavinho looked at the pile of stolen chairs and scratched his head. "Ai, que burro! Dá zero pra ele!"

Chungus clutched his long ears. "Chavinho, help me! My mind... it is crowded!"

A green parrot fluttered down from the rafters, landing on Chungus's shoulder. It didn't offer advice. It stared into the middle distance and screeched, "Hoje é bolo de uva! É o pai do cachorro pet!"

"Focus!" Chungus roared, shaking off the skeleton's greed. "We must fly!"

He grabbed Chavinho by the scruff of his shirt and marched to the sleigh. He vaulted into the driver's seat. He grabbed the reins. But as his fingers closed around the leather, the texture changed. It became cold steel. Triggers.

The reindeer weren't reindeer anymore. They were enemies. The peaceful night sky was a battlefield.

"RATATATATATATATATAT!"

Chungus screamed, but it wasn't a scream—it was the mechanical roar of Gargomon. His hands were heavy machine guns. He wasn't guiding the sleigh; he was suppressing fire. "Eat lead, you festive joyfuls!" he shouted, his mind flooded with the adrenaline of a digital gun-bunny. He pulled the reins, and the sleigh launched into the sky not with a jingle, but with the force of a tactical airstrike.

Chavinho tumbled backward into the pile of gifts. "Ninguém tem paciência comigo!" the boy wailed as the sleigh did a barrel roll.

Below them, the lights of New York City came into view. But to Chungus’s fracturing mind, it wasn't a city. The gears shifted again. The machine guns dissolved into staves of oak and crystal. The city below was a sprawling medieval hamlet.

"Hark!" Chungus bellowed, his voice taking on the grandeur of Magic Arthur. "Behold the Village of York! See how the peasants ride their Iron Horses upon the black rivers!"

He pointed at a passing Boeing 747. "A Dragon! Prepare the spells!"

He reached into the sack to throw a teddy bear, but in his mind, he was casting a Level 9 Fireball.

"Everything is magic!" Arthur-Chungus cried. "The guns are wands! The cars are steeds! The internet is a scrying pool! I am the Wizard of the North!"

The sleigh careened wildly. The Parrot was hanging on for dear life by one claw, screaming against the wind: "O churrasco lá é muito caro! O churrasco lá é muito caro!"

"Stop it!" Chungus yelled, fighting the wheel. The memories were colliding. The freezing cold of Warsaw mixed with the heat of the machine guns. The Skeleton’s greed for chairs clashed with Arthur’s noble quest.

*I am George. I am a Skeleton. I am a Bunny with Guns. I am a Wizard.*

The sleigh slammed onto a rooftop in Brazil, skidding to a halt and knocking over a chimney. Chungus fell out, landing hard on his back.

Silence returned to the night.

Chungus lay there, staring at the Southern Cross. Tears leaked from his eyes. He felt fractured, broken into five different people.

Chavinho crawled out of the wreckage, dusting off his suspenders. He looked at the disheveled Santa Chungus. "Foi sem querer querendo..." he muttered, kicking a piece of roof tile.

"I am losing my mind, Chavinho," Chungus whispered. "I am possessed. Someone is stealing my body."

Chavinho looked at him, confused. "É melhor ter ido ver o filme do Pelé," he quipped, but then he paused. He looked at Chungus with a strange, simple wisdom. "Tá bom, mas não se irrite. Se você é todo mundo... então todo mundo é você, ué."

*If you are everyone... then everyone is you.*

The Parrot landed on Chungus’s chest. "Já chegou o disco voador," it whispered softly.

Something clicked.

Chungus closed his eyes. He stopped fighting the memories. He let the cold of Warsaw in. He let the Skeleton's obsession flow through his veins. He accepted the chaos of the machine guns and the delusion of the wizard.

He realized they weren't intruders. They were *facets*.

Santa is ancient. Santa is universal. To understand the world, he had to *be* the world. He had to know the pain of the soldier to bring peace. He had to know the greed of the collector to understand the joy of giving. He had to know the chaos of battle to bring silence. He had to know the magic to bring wonder.

The moonlight hitting the roof intensified. It turned from white to a blinding, celestial silver.

Chungus began to float.

His body expanded, shifting from physical fur to pure astral projection. A third eye opened on his forehead—a lens of pure time.

"I am not broken," his voice resonated, vibrating the very tiles of the roof. "I am the Union."

He rose into the air, glowing with the power of a thousand suns. He was no longer just Santa. He was LUNORACLE CHUNGUS.

He looked down at Chavinho. "Come, my Knight of the Barrel. We have work to do."

He raised his hand—which was now a skeletal claw holding a machine gun that fired spells of peace.

"RATATATATATATAT!" he laughed, but the sound was joyful. He fired presents into the chimneys with the precision of a sniper and the flair of a wizard. He turned cars into horses for children to dream about. He left chairs—beautiful, ergonomic chairs—for the weary fathers. He left peace for the soldiers.

Chavinho hopped into the sleigh, grinning. "Isso, isso, isso!"

Lunoracle Chungus turned to the moon, his form encompassing all timelines and all realities. He was the Soldier, the Skeleton, the Gunner, the Wizard, and the Saint.

"Merry Chungusmas to all," he bellowed, shattering the sound barrier as they jumped to lightspeed.

And fading into the distance, the Parrot had the final word:

    story: `Chungus had never trusted Google Maps, but on Christmas Eve it showed him something too weird to ignore.

Right in the middle of the city there was a pin labeled:
“Merry World Plaza – Open 24/7 – Absolutely Real (Not AI)”

“Totally real,” Chungus muttered, scarf flapping as snow fell on his big fuzzy cheeks. “That’s how you know it’s fake.”

Still, curiosity beat common sense. He tapped “Start” and followed the glowing blue line through side streets and back alleys until the GPS cheerfully announced,

> “You have arrived at your… destination?”

He looked up.

The building in front of him was wrong in that special AI way: windows that had extra half-windows fused into them, doors that were slightly too tall, a sign where every letter looked almost like a letter but not quite. The neon read: M3RRY WOR1D PLΛ2A, flickering like a fever dream.

Chungus shrugged. “Christmas adventure, I guess.”

The glass doors melted into the shape of a perfect arch as he approached, like the world was being rendered in real time. Inside, the plaza stretched impossibly far, shelves blending into each other, escalators looping back into the ceiling, Christmas lights hanging from nowhere. A radio played twenty different Christmas songs at once—but somehow in key.

Right in the center, under a giant floating ornament shaped like a snowflake that had too many corners, was a banner:

> WELCOME TO THE SECRET CHUNGUS CHRISTMAS PARTY

“Oh,” Chungus said. “So that’s where I booked it.”

Dozens of Chungi—big, small, 2D, slightly glitchy—were already there, mingling under digital mistletoe and clipping through furniture. Someone had spawned a table full of snacks that kept re-generating every time you blinked.

On one of the plastic tables was a suspiciously golden bottle, sparkling under fairy lights. The label had three stickers slapped on top of each other:

* "Traveller's Piss"
* "The original Piss Baste"
* "It's infused!"

Chungus squinted at it. “Yeah, that’s definitely going to someone’s Secret Chungus gift bag.”

Over by the fake-fountain-that-was-actually-a-jpeg, a crowd had formed around a VR car parked right in the middle of the mall. It was hyper-detailed, shiny chrome yet somehow also low-poly, constantly swapping brands every few seconds.

On the hood, lounging like he was on a music video shoot, sat Deadzonee—the edgy VRChat streamer, king of scuffed avatars and terrible decisions. He had a neon jacket, sunglasses indoors, and the exact aura of someone who thought “networking” meant yelling at women in public lobbies.

“Yeah, this is my car,” Deadzonee said loudly to a group of slightly unimpressed girls. “Six-figure NFT collab, limited edition. Raytraced leather. Only real men can *own* pixels like this.”

One of the girls tapped the car. A debugging menu popped up:

> OBJECT: /World/Props/NotOwnedByDeadzonee.tscn

She raised an eyebrow. Deadzonee coughed and slid his hand over the menu like it was part of the bit.

“I let the devs store it under their account,” he said. “Tax reasons.”

Chungus waved as he walked past. Deadzonee tried to high-five him and missed, hand clipping through the hood, then snapping back with a ragdoll twitch. Truly, peak gamer.

At the edge of the plaza, sitting on a bench that subtly changed design every time you looked away, there was an orange cat.

Not just any orange cat: the orange cat.

Right now he was “acting cute at apartment” — or at least that’s what his tiny digital nametag said. He rolled over, eyes glowing with a distant, cosmic static.

Then he opened his mouth.

A sound came out that was not meant for human ears: a layered screech, like a dozen radios tuning to ghost stations at once, echoing from the deepest part of his soul. Glass shook. Lights flickered. The AI-textured floor briefly turned into a starfield.

Two Chungi walked past him, carrying a tray of cookies.

“Cat’s doing the thing again,” one said.

“Yeah,” the other replied. “He’s just *acting cute at apartment*.”

The cat stopped, blinked, then hopped off the bench and followed some partygoers toward the fake bus stop area—just a sign and a flat backdrop of a snowy street.

He jumped onto the bench there. His nametag updated to "acting cute at bus stop".

He inhaled deeply and unleashed another existential screech, this time somehow harmonizing with the jingle bells in the background. Deadzonee’s stream overlay glitched for a full five seconds.

The cat’s eyes crossed. He paused, swayed, and in a small, exhausted voice, said:

> “I am going to faint.”

Then he flopped over dramatically, tail twitching. No one seemed particularly concerned. Someone put a Santa hat on him and kept walking.

Near the artificially stretched “Horizon Food Court,” a familiar figure in a battered coat appeared: Easy Pete from New Vegas, looking like he’d taken a wrong turn at the Mojave and ended up in the algorithm.

He stared at the infinite mall for a good ten seconds, then at Chungus.

“Strangest town I’ve ever seen,” he muttered.

Across the plaza, Deadzonee tried to jump from the VR car to a glitching balcony to impress the girls, missed the edge, and faceplanted onto a looping texture of floor tiles.

Pete squinted at the scene, shook his head, and said, clearly and calmly:

> “Bastard.”

Out of nowhere, his legs kicked into full sprint animation. He started running in a perfectly straight line toward some far-off, badly rendered corridor.

“Where’s he going?” Chungus asked.

A nearby Chungus, holding a plate of pixelated brownies, just pointed.

“Some fuckass place,” he said reverently. “Every Christmas he just… starts running.”

As Pete bolted into the distance, one of the other Chungi raised their cup of suspicious eggnog and yelled:

> “Look at him go!”

The whole party paused to appreciate the sight of Easy Pete sprinting into the AI horizon, looping forever like a New Vegas NPC trapped in an escort quest gone wrong.

Then the lights dimmed.

The floating snowflake-ornament above them brightened, splitting into thousands of tiny glowing fragments. They drifted down like digital snow, softly landing on fur, jackets, the cursed bottle of "Traveller's Piss", and Deadzonee’s bruised ego.

Soft music faded in—this time just one Christmas song, a gentle, cozy one. The glitchy mall softened; its jagged AI artifacts smoothed over into something that actually felt real, or at least real enough for tonight.

Chungus looked around.

Deadzonee, now slightly humbled, was helping set up a projector to play old Christmas specials for everyone. Easy Pete had respawned at the entrance somehow and was sitting by a fake campfire, telling stories about dynamite to anyone who’d listen. The orange cat was curled up on a pillow near the tree, purring quietly, soul-screeches traded for tiny content rumblings.

The banner above the plaza slowly re-rendered itself until it read cleanly:

> SECRET CHUNGUS CHRISTMAS PARTY – YOU ARE EXACTLY WHERE YOU SHOULD BE

Someone turned on a virtual fireplace. Someone else started handing out absurd, cursed gifts: glitchy snowglobes, AI-generated sweaters with too many sleeves, and yes—one very unlucky Chungus unwrapped the bottle labeled:

> "Traveller's Piss" / "The original Piss Baste" / "It's infused!"

They all laughed so hard the mall reverb shook.

Chungus stood in the middle of it all, breathing in that weird mix of nostalgia, neon, and broken rendering. It wasn’t a real place. It wasn’t supposed to exist. But somehow, surrounded by bizarre characters, cursed drinks, and that ridiculous orange cat, it felt perfectly like Christmas.

He raised his cup.

“To us,” he said. “To this weird AI mall, to secretly real friendships, and to the best Secret Chungus Christmas party ever.”

Everyone cheered. The camera drones spun. Snow—real or not—drifted through the air.

And as the night went on, the strange plaza wrapped itself around them like a glitchy, cozy blanket—until all anyone could feel was warmth, laughter, and that quiet, shining certainty that this Christmas, at least, they weren’t alone.

The party lights twinkled, the cat snored, Easy Pete didn’t question anything, Deadzonee’s scuffed stream chat spammed hearts—and the Secret Chungus Christmas carried on, joyfully, deep inside a place that technically didn’t exist, but absolutely did.`,

    story: `Snow fell in big lazy flakes outside the windows of the North Pole Lounge, turning the world into a soft blur of white. Inside, the fireplace roared, fairy lights blinked like tiny stand-in stars, and the biggest, chunkiest Santa in recorded history adjusted his red coat and jingling belt.

Big Chungus Claus—Santa Chungus to his friends—leaned back in a too-small armchair that creaked like it was confessing a crime.

“Ahhh,” he sighed, patting his massive bunny belly. “Tonight’s the night. I can feel it. Some sort of Je No Se Quoi.”

The elves all paused, exchanging looks. They had no idea what that meant, but it sounded festive enough, so they cheered anyway.

---

At the long wooden table, guests who absolutely did **not** belong in the same continuity had gathered for Christmas Eve.

Giorno Giovanna sat straight-backed, golden hair shaped like a Renaissance crime against geometry, staring thoughtfully at the snow. “This… is a beautiful night,” he said quietly. “I, Giorno Giovanna, have a dream… that even a world this chaotic can have evenings like this.”

Next to him, Mr Smooth stirred his coffee with an expression of calm, universal cool. Mr Smooth looked like every musician you’ve ever seen and none of them at once—jazz suit, rockstar boots, EDM headphones around his neck, a country guitar leaning against his chair, and a suspiciously orchestral baton in his pocket.

There were at least five album covers with his face on the table already. Each had a different logo, different art style, different genre tag.

“Y’know,” an elf whispered, “I checked the multiverse catalog. There are… hundreds of artists called Mr Smooth. All with a song called ‘Mr Smooth.’”

Mr Smooth shrugged and, without breaking eye contact with his coffee, casually poured salt into it. Not a pinch. A cascade.

An elf’s eye twitched. “Uh… Mr Smooth? That’s, uh… salt.”

“I know,” Mr Smooth said, taking a sip with absolute composure. “It gives the bitterness… contrast.”

He nodded like this was the most normal thing in the world.

---

The door burst open in a swirl of snow and static.

“Tenno…” Captain Vor stepped in, framed by the blizzard outside, voice echoing despite the cozy acoustics of the lounge. “You cannot hide from the inevitable convergence of power and destiny. Each moment you waste in idle celebration brings you closer to—”

“Hey Vor, merry Christmas,” Santa Chungus called, waving. “Coat on the rack, boots by the fire, monologue later, yeah?”

But it was too late.

“—to the moment where all cycles return to the Origin System,” Vor continued, oblivious, pacing in front of the table. “You think these… *ornaments* and these… ‘gingerbread men’—” he pronounced it like a forbidden relic “—will save you from the crushing weight of eternity? No. They are merely distractions from the true path of—”

Giorno picked up his cocoa and attempted to talk to Mr Smooth. “I was saying, I have a dream—”

“GOLD!” a voice yelled.

Everyone flinched.

Near the snack table, a short figure in a red-and-green mining suit was aggressively staring at the wall.

Deep Rock Galactic’s Scout scraped at the baseboard with a pickaxe. “Dirt! Gotta be some Dirt around here,” he muttered. He flicked on his flare, saw a yellow ornament, and yelled, “Gold mine! Now we’re talking.”

“That’s… that’s the tree topper,” an elf said faintly.

Scout poked it anyway. “Doesn’t matter. If it shines, it’s mine.”

---

The lights flickered.

Not the festive twinkling ones—the big, reassuring overhead ones. They blinked once. Twice. Then the room fell into a hush.

From the far corner, near a big red gift box with a poorly drawn bow, something metal creaked.

An elf swallowed. “Uh… did we invite any animatronics this year?”

“No,” Santa Chungus said firmly, standing up. “We had a whole meeting about it. No pizzerias. No cursed mascots. No games where you have to check a hundred cameras.”

The gift box shuddered.

The label read: **“Totally Not A Mimic. You Can Trust This.”**

The lid opened.

The Fucking Mimic from FNAF unfolded out of it like a bad life choice, all contorted metal, false friendliness, and soulless eyes. Its voice box crackled into life.

“Hhhhi… kids…”

“NOPE,” yelled three elves in harmony.

“The Fucking Mimic??” Mr Smooth said, finally looking up from his salted coffee. “Who invited that thing?”

There was a moment of collective horrified silence.

Then, from the back, someone whispered with heartfelt relief, “Thank God they don’t got that in it. Thank God they don’t got Red ‘21’ in it.”

Everyone just quietly agreed, without really knowing what Red “21” was supposed to be. But it sounded terrible, so thank God indeed.

---

Santa Chungus clapped his big rabbit hands and the bells on his sleeves jingled like they were trying to calm everyone down.

“All right, all right. It’s Christmas, not ‘Trauma Thursday.’ Mimic, buddy, you can stay—” he pointed one massive finger, “—but no jumpscares, no weird mimicry of loved ones, and **no** haunting children’s dreams. House rules.”

The Mimic froze, lenses whirring. Then it slowly gave a jerky thumbs-up.

“And no touching the presents,” an elf added sharply.

The Mimic’s thumb sank halfway down, then back up, like it understood “probably.”

Captain Vor, who had not stopped talking this entire time, continued pacing. “—and so, as the void binds all things, you must understand that each decision creates rifts, fractures in the continuum. Even now, as you decorate your arboreal effigies, the gears of fate—”

“Dirt! Gotta be some Dirt around here,” Scout muttered, now inspecting the underside of the snack table.

He spotted a yellow napkin. “Gold mine! Now we’re talking.”

“That’s literally a napkin, Scout,” Giorno said, almost gently.

“With the right work ethic,” Scout said, stuffing it into a pouch, “it’s a **resource**.”

---

Finally, Santa Chungus stood up to his full, awe-inspiring height, casting a huge bunny-shaped shadow over the room.

“All right everyone,” he boomed. “It’s time. Gifts.”

The entire lounge went quiet.

He snapped his fingers. Presents appeared everywhere—on tables, in midair, balanced on Captain Vor’s shoulder mid-rant. Each box had the same stylized logo: **MR SMOOTH**.

“Wait,” Giorno said. “All of them?”

“Yes,” Santa Chungus said proudly. “Tonight, I bring you the greatest gift: confusion at the music section. For each of you…” He gestured and boxes floated toward their owners, “a completely different Mr Smooth album, each in a random genre style.”

An elf opened theirs. “Mine is… avant-garde bagpipe techno.”

Another checked the back of their CD. “I got… lo-fi Gregorian trap beats.”

Giorno inspected his elegant golden cover. “This says ‘Mr Smooth: Symphonic Gangster Bossa Nova.’”

Mr Smooth smiled, sipping his salted coffee. “That was a good year.”

Scout ripped his own package open. “Huh. ‘Mr Smooth: Mining Shanties Vol. 3’… Now we’re talking. Any tracks about dirt?”

“Track four,” Mr Smooth said. “And track five. And seven. And the secret track.”

“Bless you,” Scout whispered.

The Mimic awkwardly opened its box with too-long fingers. Inside was a cassette labeled “Mr Smooth: Haunted Elevator Jazz.”

The Mimic’s lenses flickered blue. It emitted a little happy static chirp.

Even Captain Vor got one. He paused in the middle of: “—and so you must accept—” and stared at the cover.

“‘Mr Smooth: Cosmic Void Psalms’…” he muttered. For the first time all evening, Vor went quiet.

“Some sort of Je No Se Quoi, right?” Santa Chungus said, winking.

Vor actually nodded.

---

Snow piled higher outside. Inside, the fire crackled, mugs of cocoa refilled themselves, and someone finally turned on the old TV in the corner.

On the screen, the opening beats of a very familiar song started.

“Is that…?” Giorno tilted his head.

“Oh yeah,” Santa Chungus said. “Christmas tradition.”
The TV proudly displayed **PSY - Gangnam Style**, complete with Santa hat crudely drawn over his head by some ancient elf.

Scout, with a big chunk of gingerbread in hand, looked around at the bizarre assembly—an Italian mafioso with a noble dream, a genre-unstable musician salting his coffee, a void-obsessed space warlord quietly reading liner notes, an animatronic horror bobbing its head to jazz, and himself trying to locate dirt under the rug.

“This is weird,” he admitted. “But, uh… cozy.”

“Christmas is like that,” Santa Chungus said, watching the snow. “Chaos, noise, people that make no sense together… and somehow it all feels right.”

Giorno smiled faintly. “Then maybe my dream isn’t so far away.”

Captain Vor, without looking up from his album’s lyrics booklet, murmured, “Even in the cold void… there is warmth.”

Mr Smooth raised his mug. “To strange nights and stranger playlists.”

The Mimic tried to clap, got its joints tangled, and knocked over an empty chair. Nobody minded.

Outside, the wind howled. Inside, the room was warm, loud, and full of that strange, indefinable, absolutely undeniable Christmas feeling.

    story: `Snow fell softly over Kamurocho-that-definitely-wasn’t-Kamurocho, turning neon streets and crooked alleyways into a glowing Christmas postcard.

The whole town was on break. Even the PS2 shops had their shutters half-open, humming with that crunchy old-disc sound like it was 2005 again.

Inside a tiny retro game bar, a group had gathered around a battered CRT.

“Another run?” Taiga Saejima rumbled, holding a PS2 controller like it owed him money.

Dante from Limbus Company lounged on a stool backwards, scarf slightly dusted with snow. “You mortals and your *old hardware*,” he said, grinning. “But fine. One more. If I lose, I buy the next round of hot cocoa.”

On the screen, *Yakuza 2* blared its intro. Taiga and Dante were locked in a chaotic mini-game marathon: batting cages, karaoke, pocket racing – all done via squeaky controller analog sticks. Every time Taiga hit a home run, the whole bar shook with his laugh. Every time Dante missed a timing in karaoke, he slammed the controller down and declared, “Input lag. I blame the universe.”

Outside, in the snow-covered plaza, an AI dog was having its own Christmas adventure.

It was a strange little thing: half-robot, half-corgi, with LED eyes that flickered in emoji. It trotted up to a festive fruit stand, scanned an apple with a soft beep, and decided that this was, statistically, a Good Apple.

It chomped it.

The apple stand’s owner was not there to complain, but someone else was.

From a nearby alley, a bizarre snake man slithered out. Not quite human, not quite serpent, wearing a tacky Christmas scarf and a trench coat two sizes too big. He pointed at the AI dog.

“HEY! That apple had *emotional value*!” he hissed.

The AI dog, guilty LED eyes widening, dropped the core and bolted.

The snake man gave chase, weaving through snow piles, knocking over snowmen and confusing pigeons. The AI dog zipped past the game bar windows, leaving a trail of digital pawprints on the snow. Dante glanced outside mid-match.

“…Is that normal here?” he asked.

Taiga shrugged, not even looking away from the screen. “It’s Christmas,” he said. “Everything’s side content today.”

---

Down the tracks, just outside town, Kyriu was… driving a train.

Not metaphorically.

A real, honest-to-god, snow-dusted locomotive.

He’d somehow been talked into it as a “wholesome Christmas event” for the kids: the Legendary Dragon of Dojima doing a charity train ride around the town, delivering presents and snacks. He took it seriously, standing in the driver’s cabin in a neat coat and red scarf.

The station manager pointed at the horn lever.

“Only when absolutely needed,” he said. “It’s loud. Don’t scare the townsfolk.”

Kyriu nodded solemnly.

Five minutes into the ride, surrounded by soft carols and the muffled chatter of children, Kyriu looked at the horn.

He thought: *What’s the worst that could happen?*

He pulled it.

The horn shattered the peaceful night like a boss battle intro.

In the plaza, the snake man jumped ten feet in the air and accidentally wrapped himself around a lamppost. The AI dog’s LED eyes switched to "! ! !" as it skid in the snow.

In the retro bar, everyone jolted. Taiga’s character failed a heat move; Dante dropped his cocoa. Someone in the back yelled, “I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ENCOUNTER ALERT!”

All over town, Christmas lights flickered as if they too had been scared.

Kyriu winced in the cabin.

“…I may have overdone it,” he admitted quietly.

The children, though, were delighted.

“AGAIN!” they shouted.

Kyriu shook his head. “No. I’ve… learned my lesson. We don’t jumpscare people with the horn. Especially at Christmas.”

He gently pushed the controls, guiding the train smoothly along the snowy curve, deciding that from now on, the horn was only for safety, not for surprise.

---

As the evening deepened, everyone drifted toward the town square, drawn by the smell of warm food and the sound of festive music.

The AI dog finally stopped running and cautiously peeked out from behind a snowbank. The snake man, now calmer and handed a fresh apple by a kind old vendor, sighed and patted the dog on its metallic head.

“Alright, alright,” he said. “We’ll call it even. Merry Christmas, you data-chewing gremlin.”

The AI dog projected a tiny holographic heart as an apology.

Taiga and Dante emerged from the bar, still arguing about whether Dante really lost fair and square.

“I told you,” Taiga said. “No input lag. You just can’t mash like you used to.”

“I’m filing a complaint with reality itself,” Dante muttered.

Kyriu arrived next, stepping down from the train, still embarrassed about the horn incident. A group of kids ran up to him.

“Thanks for the ride, mister!” they said.

He smiled gently. “Just… sorry about the noise.”

One of the kids shook their head. “It was awesome!”

All around the square, stalls offered hot cocoa, takoyaki, grilled skewers, and sweet Christmas snacks. Someone had set up a PS2 in a little booth where kids could try out old *Yakuza* games, their faces lit up both by the CRT glow and the falling snow.

Snowflakes drifted down, catching on coats, hair, and scarves.

Then, the music stopped.

The lights dimmed.

From the sky – or honestly, it felt like from some parallel meme dimension – a massive sleigh descended, pulled not by reindeer, but by equally massive floating carrots.

Landing in the center of the square with a soft *thud*, out stepped…

Santa Chungus.

A huge, jolly rabbit-Santa hybrid with a red suit stretched to its absolute limit, fluffy white beard slightly crooked, and a sack that looked physically incapable of obeying the laws of space.

“HO HO HO,” Santa Chungus boomed, snow puffing away from his boots. “I HEARD THERE WERE SOME GOOD BOYS, GIRLS, AND MILDLY TERRIFYING CREATURES HERE TONIGHT.”

Everyone gathered around.

The AI dog received a polished metal chew toy shaped like an apple, impossible to dent. The snake man got a basket of real apples, each with a little tag that said “NOT FOR DRAMA.”

Taiga unwrapped a limited-edition PS2 controller, rugged enough to survive his grip. Dante opened his gift to find a perfectly balanced, holiday-themed weapon that somehow doubled as a thermos.

Kyriu received a tiny train conductor hat and a note: “FOR RESPONSIBLE HORN USAGE ONLY.”

He chuckled, slipping it on.

The whole square erupted into laughter and chatter. People danced in the snow, kids chased holographic snowflakes projected by the AI dog, and Taiga started retelling, in increasingly exaggerated detail, the story of how Dante “lost ten matches in a row” (it was only three, but nobody corrected him).

Someone put on music. Lanterns and fairy lights glowed warm against the cold blue of the winter sky. It was one of those nights that felt like it could last forever.

And then—

Without fanfare, without logic, without any buildup at all:

then Morbius showed up and everyone was happy.

    story: `'Twas the night before Christmas, in the Digital Circus domain, not a creature was stirring, except for a Chungus with a singular, burning brain. While the others, like Jax and Ragatha, were adorning the abstract tree with glitching baubles and tinsel made of pure light, the Chungus lurked in the shadows of the tent, his wide, round body quivering with anticipation.

His name was Bartholomew Chungus the Third, but tonight, he was simply a chungee on a mission. And his mission was as specific as it was strange: to behold the glorious, stocking-clad feet of the newest resident, Pomni.

He had been obsessed since the day she abstracted, her frantic, twitching movements a ballet of panic. And her feet! Oh, her little feet, so often clad in those pristine white and red jester's shoes, were the focal point of her chaotic energy. To him, they were not just feet; they were symbols of her desperate, adorable sanity. And tonight, on Christmas, he would see them sans shoes. He had to.

The plan was simple. Under the guise of being "Santa's Little Helper," he would deliver a special, "ergonomic" Christmas stocking filled with the softest, most luxurious digital lamb's wool, a gift that required immediate testing on bare feet for maximum comfort validation.

He found her curled up on a plush, pixelated sofa, staring at the hypnotic glow of the tree. Her jester's hat drooped, and for once, she was still.

"Pomni!" he boomed, his voice a low rumble. He waddled forward, holding the stocking aloft like a sacred relic. "A gift! For you! For your... extremities."

Pomni jumped, her eyes wide with their usual deer-in-the-headlights panic. "W-what? My what?"

"Your feet, dear girl!" Chungus explained, his eyes gleaming. "They work so hard, carrying you through all this... delightful chaos. They deserve a Christmas treat!"

He thrust the stocking toward her. "This! This is filled with cloud-wool. You must try it. Immediately. Take off your shoes. Let your toes breathe the festive air!"

Pomni blinked, clutching her knees to her chest. "My... toes? I... I don't think that's a good idea. What if they glitch?"

"Nonsense!" Chungus pleaded, his large form beginning to sweat little ^-^ emoticons. "It's Christmas! The night of miracles! The perfect time for... foot liberation!"

Just as he was about to drop to his knees and beg, a voice sliced through the silence.

"Having a little foot fetish festival without me, Chungee-Wungee?"

Jax dropped from a hoop above, landing with a silent thud and a smirk that could curdle eggnog. He looked from Chungus's desperate face to Pomni's confused one.

"The big guy's been sketching your shoes in his diary for weeks, Pomni," Jax said, his grin widening. "He's your Secret Chungus. His message was probably a sonnet about your soles."

Chungus turned a shade of red reminiscent of a corrupted sleigh. "It is an appreciation of form and function! A celebration of pedal dexterity under duress!"

Pomni looked down at her feet, then at the desperately hopeful Chungus, and then at the mocking Jax. A tiny, unexpected smile touched her lips. It was the first real one in a long time. This was, without a doubt, the weirdest, most specific obsession she had ever encountered. But in this madhouse, it was also... kind of sweet.

With a deep breath, she slowly, deliberately, untied one red ribbon, then the other. She slipped off the first shoe, then the second, revealing her white and red striped stockings.

Chungus gasped as if witnessing the birth of a new star. He stared, mesmerized, at the subtle wiggle of her toes through the fabric.

"There," Pomni said softly. "Sock-feet. That's as liberated as they're getting tonight, okay?"

It was enough. For Bartholomew Chungus the Third, it was everything. It was a Christmas miracle. He gently placed the cloud-wool stocking in her lap.

"Merry Christmas, Pomni," he whispered, his voice full of reverence. "May your steps always be... comforted."

Jax just shook his head, chuckling. "This place gets weirder every year."

And as digital snow began to fall inside the big top, Chungus waddled away, his heart full, his secret revealed, and his chungee mission for Pomni's feet finally, blissfully, complete.`,

    story: `Chungus loved Christmas, but Christmas did not always love Chungus back.

For starters, there was the Opila Bird problem.

Every time the wind rattled the window or a decoration creaked, Chungus jolted like he’d just heard a Garten of Banban jumpscare. The apartment was cozy – fairy lights, a lopsided tree, mugs of hot chocolate – but every shadow on the wall looked, to him, exactly like a big pink bird with soulless eyes.

“I swear she’s out there,” Chungus whispered, peeking through the curtains. “Watching. Waiting. Judging my ornaments.”

On the couch sat George Miller, the old senile man from Warsaw, Poland, wrapped in a blanket like a grumpy Christmas pierogi. He squinted at Chungus.

“In my day,” George muttered, “we fear real birds. With real beaks. Not… pastel demon poultry from video games.”

He promptly forgot what he was saying halfway through, stared at the Christmas tree, and nodded gravely at it like they’d just agreed on something important.

Near the door, Grayson – a.k.a. *“the man who does actual kicking”* – was adjusting the tree. By kicking it.

Thump. Thump. Perfectly measured kicks to nudge it into place.

“No nails, no tools,” Grayson said. “Only precision kicks.”

Every time the tree tilted, he’d give it a single controlled kick and it would swing back into perfect alignment. The ornaments trembled, the star rattled, the lights flickered—and somehow, it all ended up looking better.

Across the room, the sliding door opened with a soft *shhhh*, letting in a puff of cold winter air and a sprinkle of snowflakes.

Yukari stepped in, scarf wrapped neatly, hair perfectly in place despite the cold, looking like she’d just stepped out of a shrine-themed fashion catalog. She smelled faintly of soap and winter perfume, because Yukari, as everyone knew, showered three times a day.

“Sorry I’m late,” she said, closing the door with a smile. “Third shower took longer than expected. Pipes are cold this time of year.”

Chungus immediately forgot about Opila Bird.

“Y-Yukari! You came!” he squeaked, his ears going red.

“Of course,” Yukari said. “Secret Chungus night is sacred.”

Behind her trotted *The Cat*.

The Cat was not just any cat. The Cat was a being of infinite soul screeches, a small, fluffy anomaly of the universe. He paused in the doorway, looked around at everyone with wide, glimmering eyes, then flopped onto the floor dramatically.

Yukari checked her phone. “So, today’s activity log says: ‘acting cute at apartment’…” She glanced down as The Cat rolled onto his back, paws curled, tail twitching delicately. “…and earlier he was ‘acting cute at bus stop’ all afternoon.”

Chungus stared. “He’s… he’s just… vibrating with adorableness.”

The Cat took a deep breath.

And then the screeching began.

Not angry screeching. Not scared screeching.

Soul screeching.

A long, echoing, rising “REEEEEEEEEE—” that sounded like a thousand tiny spirits being released into the snowy night. The windows trembled. The Christmas lights buzzed in sympathy. Somewhere in the building, a neighbor paused and reconsidered their life choices.

George tilted his head. “Ah yes,” he said, approvingly. “That is how we used to sing carols in Warsaw.”

The screech did not stop.

Chungus clapped his hands over his ears, laughing and wincing at the same time. “He’s been going on like this since the bus stop?”

“Pretty much,” Yukari said. “He saw a pigeon, tried flirting with it, and it ignored him. He’s been having a spiritual meltdown ever since.”

Finally, after what felt like a full minute of uninterrupted cosmic screaming, The Cat fell silent, wobbling on his paws. His eyes crossed slightly.

“I am going to faint,” he announced in a tiny, dignified voice.

He flopped into Yukari’s arms like a ragdoll, purring immediately.

The apartment settled back into peaceful Christmas warmth. Snow drifted outside the window. The tree glowed softly, now perfectly aligned thanks to Grayson’s tactical kicks. The hot chocolate steamed, marshmallows slowly melting. A distant car radio played muffled Christmas music.

Chungus shuffled nervously closer to Yukari.

“S-So, uh… thank you for coming,” he said. “I know you’re busy. With… you know. Showering three times a day. And… being perfect.”

Yukari laughed, the sound light and warm. “You’re cute when you’re nervous, you know that?”

Chungus’ brain bluescreened for a moment.

By the coffee table, George poked at a present. “Which one of these is mine?” he asked.

“That one,” Grayson said, pointing with his foot. “But don’t open yet. Secret Chungus rules.”

“Secret what?”

“Secret *Chungus*,” Chungus corrected softly. “Like Secret Santa. But stupider.”

“I see,” George said thoughtfully. He did not see.

They all gathered in a loose circle around the tree, exchanging glances, smiling, soaking in the glow of the lights and the quiet crackle of the imaginary fireplace stream playing on the TV. For one rare moment, everything felt still and safe.

Even Chungus noticed that Opila Bird had not, in fact, smashed through the window yet.

Grayson clapped his hands once. “Alright. Tradition time.”

Chungus blinked. “Tradition?”

“Yeah,” Grayson said. “Every year, before we reveal who’s gifting who, you—” he pointed at Chungus, “—do a dance to bless the Secret Chungus ritual.”

“That’s not a real tradition,” Chungus protested.

“It is now,” Yukari said. “And I want to see it.”

The Cat cracked one eye open from her arms, as if to say *same*.

Chungus swallowed. His heart pounded. His fear of Opila Bird, the weight of the night, the warmth of the room, Yukari’s smile—everything mashed together inside him like a chaotic snowball of adrenaline.

“A dance… right now?” he asked.

George nodded solemnly. “In Warsaw, we always dance before opening gifts. Sometimes by accident.”

Grayson stepped back to clear some space in the middle of the room. The lights on the tree reflected off the window, making Chungus’ reflection look taller, cooler, more confident than he felt.

Yukari folded her arms, grinning. “Come on, Chungus. Show me your mating dance.”

He froze. “My what.”

“You know,” she said, eyes sparkling. “The one you said you’d do one day if we ever had a perfect Christmas night.”

Chungus’ ears burned. He remembered saying that. Quietly. Half-joking. Half-praying the universe would never call him on it.

But here they were. Cozy room. Snow outside. Friends together. The Cat asleep after delivering his infinite soul screeches to the world. George humming a half-remembered carol from Warsaw. Grayson leaning on one leg, ready to kick any structural problem that might appear.

And Yukari, right in front of him, waiting.

Chungus took a deep breath.

“Alright,” he said. “But if Opila Bird crashes through the window while I’m doing this, I’m haunting all of you.”

He pulled out his phone, scrolled quickly, and a familiar beat began to play. Not too loud, just enough for them to hear the rhythm: that instantly recognizable track.

He stepped into the center of the room.

Grayson started clapping along to the beat. George clapped off-beat, which somehow made it better. Yukari’s eyes were wide, shining, a hand over her mouth in anticipation.

Chungus closed his eyes for a second.

This is for Christmas.
This is for Secret Chungus.
This is for Yukari.

He opened his eyes—

—and launched straight into it.

The full Gangnam Style horse dance. The sideways steps, the arm swings, the invisible reins. His little legs committed. His arms committed. His soul committed. He danced like Opila Bird herself was chasing him, like The Cat’s screeches were fueling his stamina, like every awkward Christmas in his life had been training for this exact moment.

Yukari burst out laughing, not mocking, but delighted. The Cat woke up just to watch, pupils huge. Grayson whooped. George attempted to copy the dance and nearly spun into the couch.

Chungus spun, hopped, and galloped in a perfect loop around the tree, ending right in front of Yukari, panting, still doing tiny, exhausted versions of the moves.

The music faded out.

There was a heartbeat of silence, like the apartment itself was catching its breath.

Then everyone moved at once.

Yukari threw her arms around him. Grayson stepped in and pulled them both into a big, warm hug. George shuffled closer, patting Chungus on the back with surprising gentleness. The Cat wedged himself into the middle of the pile, purring like a tiny engine.

They all hugged and clapped, laughter echoing through the cozy Christmas night, as Chungus – red-faced, grinning, and wildly in love – finished his very best Gangnam Style mating dance for Yukari.`,

i like digimon and cinnamoroll :thumbs_up:`,

    story: ` Snow fell softly over the little neighborhood, but no house looked quite as strange—or as festive—as the Cat House.

The Cat House was exactly what it sounded like: a big cozy house shaped like a cat. The roof curved like ears, the front windows were giant glowing eyes, and the front door was a little pink nose that opened with a squeak. Tonight, colored Christmas lights traced along every whisker-shaped beam, blinking in cheerful patterns as carols played from somewhere inside.

Inside the Cat House lived Gargo Chungus.

Gargo Chungus was… a lot. Imagine Big Chungus, but mixed with Galgomon—the rabbit from Digimon with gun hands. He was a massive, round rabbit with fluffy cheeks, stubby legs, and big mechanical blaster-hands that whirred and clicked every time he moved. He wore a cozy red Christmas sweater that said “HO-HO-HOG” because the printing company messed up, and he decided that made it even better.

He also, for some reason, owned way too many chairs.

Every room in the Cat House was full of chairs. Wooden chairs, metal chairs, beanbags that insisted on being called chairs, even one chair that was just three smaller chairs taped together. There were chairs on top of chairs. Stacked in corners. Lined along the walls like they were waiting for a concert that never started.

“Jessicat says maybe Gargo has… problem,” he muttered to himself, hopping sideways through a narrow gap between a recliner and a rocking chair. “But Gargo say: never know when many friends visit!”

Jessicat, his wife, padded into the kitchen on silent paws. She was a sleek, graceful cat-woman with soft fur, a cute apron that said “KISS THE COOK (OR PET THE CAT),” and a patience level that had been tested by exactly one thing in this world: Gargo’s cooking.

In the middle of the chaos, the kitchen was buzzing. Snow piled on the windowsills, the sky outside glowing a pale blue, while inside the lights over the counter shone warm and gold.

Gargo was making soup.

Not just any soup—he was making **The Christmas Chair Soup**, named that because he said, “Is soup you eat while sitting on chair you really like.”

He stirred a bubbling pot with one of his gun-hands, managing not to shoot anything by pure Christmas miracle.

“Needs… more something,” Gargo murmured. He rummaged through the spice rack, then through a drawer, then through a pile of random objects.

Salt? Pepper? Garlic?

No.

His hand closed on a small plastic shape. A walkie talkie.

“Ah, perfect seasoning!” he said proudly.

Jessicat turned just in time to see him casually plop the walkie talkie into the pot.

*PLUNK.*

There was a soft sizzling sound and then, from somewhere inside the soup, a tiny crackling voice:
*krrrrshhh… testing… testing… one-two—*

“GARGO!” Jessicat yowled. “That is not a seasoning!”

Gargo blinked. “But now soup can… talk. Very festive.”

Jessicat massaged her temples. “Take it out before it calls your mother.”

---

Across the living room, more chaos was happening.

The Cat House had many cats. Too many, some would say. There were stripey cats, fluffy cats, bald cats, grumpy cats, extra-grumpy cats, and one cat who just stared at walls like they owed him money.

The king among them was Anakin.

Anakin was the main cat of the house, a strange mix of terrifying and pathetic. He was really, *really* aggressive—hissing at shadows, swatting at air, trying to bite the vacuum—but also really, *really* needy. He demanded cuddles every five minutes. He would slam his head into your hand like a furry meteor until you petted him.

He was also… not very smart.

Right now, Anakin sat on the TV stand, directly in front of the camera that was meant to stream their Christmas party for Gargo’s distant friends.

“Anakin, move,” Jessicat said, gently nudging him.

Anakin stared at the camera. Sat down harder. His tail flicked. The red recording light reflected in his eyes, making him look like a possessed Christmas ornament.

He purred loudly, drowning out the carols. No one could see anything on the stream except his gigantic face.

“Look at him,” Jessicat sighed. “You blocking the whole world, you little disaster.”

Anakin rubbed his face against the lens.

---

In the corner, on a pedestal of stacked chairs, sat the pride of the household:
The ugly, bizarre big chungus clay model.

Gargo and Jessicat had made it together one night when the power went out. It was lumpy, crooked, slightly melty-looking, and somehow always seemed to be staring into your soul no matter where you stood. Its eyes were uneven, its teeth were too many, and its ears were different lengths.

Jessicat purred proudly whenever she passed by.
“This is our greatest craft,” she said. “Our magnum opus.”

Cinnamoroll, the soft white puppy with long floppy ears, floated nearby, looking at the clay statue with wide, polite eyes. “It’s… very… expressive…”

From behind him popped Terriermon, the cutest creature in the entire house. Small, green-marked, floppy-eared, and full of energy, he hopped up onto Cinnamoroll’s back.

“I LOVE IT,” Terriermon declared. “IT’S SO UGLY IT’S POWERFUL.”

“Terriermon, Cinnamoroll!” Gargo called out from the kitchen. “You come visit just in time! Tonight is Christmas Eve party!”

They had just arrived, little snowflakes still clinging to their fur. They shook themselves off, sending a gentle flurry of snow into the air. The cats immediately chased the falling flakes like tiny idiots.

“Let’s go on an adventure later!” Terriermon whispered to Cinnamoroll. “We can surf on chairs and slide down the cat tail roof!”

Cinnamoroll wagged his ears. “That sounds… amazing.”

---

On the windowsill, there sat perhaps the strangest feline in the whole house:
“Ugly ass Cat.”

That was his actual name.

He was, objectively, deeply unfortunate to look at. Patchy fur, mismatched eyes, a crooked mouth that always seemed stuck halfway between a hiss and a confused “mrow.” His tail had exactly three hairs on it.

He watched the room with a permanent expression of offended surprise.

Anytime anyone came within a meter of him, he’d immediately puff up, growl, and act like they had personally insulted his entire bloodline.

But Jessicat loved him.

Jessicat walked over, scooped him up despite the immediate growling and tiny slaps, and cuddled him to her chest.

“Who’s my handsome boy?” she cooed.

Ugly ass Cat hissed, snarled, and then immediately began purring like a lawnmower.

“See?” Jessicat said proudly. “He’s adorable.”

The other cats looked traumatized.

---

As night fell, the doorbell rang.

*DING-DONG.*
*DING-DING-DING-DONG-DING.*

Gargo bounced over, squeezing between two rocking chairs and nearly knocking over a beanbag throne.

He flung the door open.

Standing there in the snow was a man in a blue shirt, with a blue cap, and a very specific kind of presence:
Caneta Azul himself.

“Boa noite!” Caneta Azul said, stepping in carefully, looking around at all the chairs blocking every path. “Meu Deus, quanta cadeira…”

Gargo beamed. “Caneta Azul! Gargo big fan! Your song… stuck in head for three years!”

Caneta Azul laughed and adjusted his cap. “É assim mesmo.”

Soon, he sat on one of the thousands of chairs—an especially squeaky one—strumming his guitar. As cats weaved between chair legs and snowflakes drifted down outside, his familiar song filled the house:

“Caneta azul… azul caneta…”

Terriermon and Cinnamoroll danced in little circles.
Jessicat hummed along as she set the table.
Even Anakin paused his angry staring contest with the camera to listen, blinking slowly, then kneading the streaming laptop with his paws.

---

Meanwhile, back in the kitchen, Gargo had moved on from soup to… coffee.

He carefully set up a little coffee pot, humming along to Caneta Azul’s singing. Jessicat walked in just in time to see him reach for the salt shaker.

“Gargo,” she said slowly. “What are you doing?”

“Making special Christmas coffee for Jessicat,” he said proudly. “Need… extra flavor.”

He unscrewed the salt shaker.

Dumped it.

Directly.

Into the coffee.

The entire pot.

Jessicat stared in horror. “That’s not ‘extra flavor.’ That’s a crime.”

But Gargo only smiled, poured the coffee into a cute mug with a cartoon cat on it, and handed it to her with giant shining eyes.

“For Jessicat.”

She took a deep breath. It was Christmas. He had tried.

Jessicat took a sip.

Her entire face scrunched up. “YUCK!”

Ugly ass Cat hissed in agreement from across the room, as if personally offended by the salt level.

Gargo looked crushed for half a second… then Jessicat saw it. He really was trying to make everything perfect.

She sighed, smiled, and gave him a little kiss on the cheek. “We’ll… work on your recipes, meu amor. But thank you.”

He brightened again instantly.

---

As the evening went on, Terriermon and Cinnamoroll went on their “crazy adventure.”

They turned the stair rail into a slide.
They used the chairs as a parkour course.
They climbed up to the Cat House’s roof and slid down one of the “whiskers” into a snowbank, laughing the entire way.

The other cats joined in, chasing them, pouncing at their ears, occasionally knocking over a chair or two (or ten). Anakin tried to chase everyone, then got distracted by his own reflection in a window and started hissing at it instead.

Inside, the walkie talkie in the soup kept occasionally crackling:

*krrrrshhh… you have reached… vegetable headquarters… over…*

Nobody knew how to fix it, so they just treated it as a bonus Christmas guest.

---

Then, sometime around midnight, it happened.

Gargo had started washing dishes…
Or, more accurately, he had turned on the kitchen sink.

And then forgotten about it.

For an entire hour.

The faucet gushed, water filling the sink… then spilling over… then creeping across the floor… then pouring down the stairs… soaking the carpets… the chairs… the cats…

Soon, the Cat House was no longer just a house.

It was an aquarium.

Water sloshed gently through the hallways. Chairs floated like boats. Cats swam in weird little panic-circles and then realized… this was actually kind of fun.

Terriermon grabbed onto a floating cushion. “THIS IS THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER!”

Cinnamoroll drifted by holding three kittens like life rafts. “I didn’t know we had this many cats.”

Anakin dog-paddled aggressively at the camera lens, managing to block it *even underwater*, his angry little face pressed against it in a blur of bubbles.

Ugly ass Cat floated on a cutting board like a tiny furious emperor, hissing at absolutely everything and everyone.

Jessicat clung to a chair with Caneta Azul, who was still somehow holding his guitar above the water. He improvised a new line:

“Caneta azul… azul caneta…
A casa virou… uma grande aquarela…”

Gargo, for his part, was having the time of his life. He clung to a floating beanbag, spinning around in circles.

“See?” he shouted joyfully. “This why Gargo need many chairs! Emergency boat supply!”

Jessicat squinted. “…Okay. One point for you.”

---

And then, just as the chaos reached its peak, the chimney—located right between the Cat House’s cat ears—shook.

*THUMP.*
*THUD.*
*WHUMP.*

A huge, round shape fell straight down, splashing into the water-filled living room and sending waves everywhere.

When the bubbles cleared, there he was:

Santa Chungus.

A massive, jolly rabbit figure in a red suit, white beard, and a sack slung over his shoulder. His belly shook like jelly as he floated there, completely unfazed by the indoor ocean.

“HO… HO… HO!” Santa Chungus boomed, paddling to the nearest cluster of chairs. “Merry Christmas, everyone!”

The cats stared.
Terriermon waved.
Cinnamoroll squeaked.
Gargo saluted for some reason.

Santa Chungus carefully opened his sack. Inside were dozens and dozens of beautifully wrapped presents. Red paper, golden ribbons, silver bows, each one with a little name tag.

He paddled around, handing them out.

“To Terriermon! To Cinnamoroll! To Jessicat! To Gargo! To Anakin! To Ugly ass Cat! To every kitty in this house! To Caneta Azul!”

Everyone clutched their soggy gifts excitedly. The water glowed with the reflection of the Christmas lights as they all gathered in a floating circle of chairs, cushions, and cats.

“On three, we open, yes?” Gargo said, eyes shining.

“One…”
“Two…”
“THREE!”

They all tore open their wrapping paper.

It took about half a second.

Then silence.

Every single box contained…

A mug.

A steaming mug.

Of coffee.

Salt coffee.

Exactly the same as the cursed one Gargo had made earlier.

Jessicat sniffed hers cautiously. “Oh no.”

Terriermon took a sip, eyes widening. “THIS TASTES LIKE SOMEONE LIQUIFIED MY REGRETS.”

Cinnamoroll blinked twice, trying to be polite. “It’s… very… memorable.”

Anakin knocked his mug straight into the water, hissed at it, then immediately climbed onto Gargo’s shoulder demanding cuddles.

Ugly ass Cat batted his mug off the chair, then sat where it used to be like that had been the plan all along.

Caneta Azul stared into his cup. “…Pelo menos é azul por dentro da minha alma agora.”

Jessicat looked at Gargo. Gargo looked at Jessicat. Then at Santa Chungus.

Santa Chungus floated there, watching them expectantly. “Well? Do you… like your presents?”

For a moment, the entire house was quiet.

Then Jessicat smiled.

“It’s terrible,” she said honestly. “But… it’s also kind of perfect.”

Terriermon nodded. “It’s so bad it wrapped around and became legendary.”

Cinnamoroll giggled. “It tastes like… this exact night. Messy, weird, but warm.”

Gargo chuckled, wrapping an arm around Jessicat. “Is okay. Gargo not good cook. But Gargo good at… making memories?”

She leaned into him, flicking her tail. “You’re amazing at that.”

Everyone raised their awful salty coffee mugs.

“To this ridiculous Christmas,” Jessicat said. “To too many chairs, too many cats, and way too much salt.”

“And,” Gargo added, “to Santa Chungus and all friends who visit Cat House.”

They clinked their mugs together. The coffee was disgustingly salty. No one finished it. But everyone smiled anyway.

Outside, the snow kept falling softly on the cat-shaped roof. Inside, the flooded, glowing, chaotic Cat House was filled with laughter, purring, music, and the weird crackle of a walkie talkie echoing from inside the soup:

    story: `The North Pole was usually a symphony of jingling bells and elf giggles. But on this particular Christmas Eve, inside the massive Candy Cane Citadel, the air smelled faintly of ozone, burnt cookies, and intense confusion.

At the center of it all stood Santa Chungus. He was magnificent. A towering monolith of fluff, clad in a red velvet suit the size of a circus tent. His belly didn't just shake like a bowlful of jelly; it oscillated with the gravitational pull of a small moon. He was ready to deliver presents. The sleigh was packed.

Then, the lockdown sirens began to blare. Jingle Bells was replaced by an abrasive Klaxon alarm.

KLANG. KLANG. KLANG.

Massive steel shutters slammed down over every door and window of the workshop. Red emergency lights started strobing.

A holographic projection flickered to life in the center of the room. It was a wrinkled, gray-skinned figure with glowing yellow energy crackling around his chest key. Captain Vor from the Grineer Empire.

"Look at them," Vor’s voice boomed, echoing horribly in the festive space. "They come to this workshop when they know they are not pure. Naughty list inhabitants use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Christmas Spirit. I have converted this entire facility into a deadly ESCAPE ROOM. Solve my puzzles, or Christmas is canceled!"

Santa Chungus blinked his massive eyes slowly. "Bruh," he rumbled, the sound vibrating the floorboards.

The workshop was in chaos. The elves were panicking. But the guests Santa Chungus had invited for the pre-flight party were taking it even worse.

Over by the fireplace, a man with a scruffy beard and a beanie sat slumped in front of a computer monitor that was somehow still broadcasting to Twitch. It was Vinesauce Vinny.

"Chat," Vinny muttered, rubbing his temples, looking profoundly weary. "Chat, I don't know what game this is. The graphics are incredible, but the softlocks are insane. I think the game crashed. I’m trapped in a Christmas glitch hell. Someone clip this."

Suddenly, a blur of metallic blue light zipped around the room, knocking over stacks of presents. It was Gauss, the speedster Warframe. He slammed face-first into a reinforced shutter. CLANG.

"I cannot breach the perimeter!" Gauss vibrated with impatient energy. "My kinetic plating is useless against festive steel!"

"Patience, rapid one!" A voice boomed from near the dazzling Christmas tree. It was Inspector Hildibrand Helidor Maximilian Manderville, striking an impossibly muscular pose while wearing a tiny Santa hat tilted jauntily on his head. "A gentleman detective knows that every locked room is merely a truth waiting to be undressed!"

Hildibrand spun around and pointed dramatically at a piece of furniture in the center of the room. It wasn't a cozy armchair. It was a baroque, spiky gothic throne made of black iron and dried bloodstains—a ‘Murder Chair’ straight from an Eorzean dungeon.

"This chair!" Hildibrand declared. "It is clearly a clue! A puzzle involving seating arrangements!"

Next to the Murder Chair were several normal, comfortable wooden chairs. Standing next to them were two guards from the Imperial City of Cyrodiil. They seemed deeply distressed.

"Need something?" one guard asked robotically.

"We must sit to solve the puzzle," Hildibrand commanded.

The Elder Scrolls guards attempted to comply. It was horrifying.

One guard approached a wooden chair, turned his back to it, and began the sitting animation. However, he missed the chair entirely. He slowly descended into a squatting position in thin air two feet to the left of the seat, groaning as if in immense pain.

The second guard fared worse. He tried to sit, clipped through the seat of the chair, began rapidly vibrating, stretched into a horrific spaghetti-monster of polygons, and then snapped back into a standing position on top of the table.

"Must have been the wind," the guard muttered, staring blankly at the ceiling.

Vinny watched this from his corner. "Yeah, chat, the physics engine is completely broken. This is worse than Collapsed."

Santa Chungus waddled forward. The sheer presence of his Chungus-ness parted the crowd. He looked at the chaotic scene: the rambling holographic villain, the twitching speedster, the posing detective, the glitching guards, and the depressed streamer.

He knew this wasn't just a puzzle. He sniffed the air. Amidst the peppermint, he smelled... deception. It smelled like cheap cigarettes and a suspiciously expensive suit.

A "Red Team" elf was standing near the sleigh control panel, sweating nervously. He was fiddling with a sapper device attached to the reindeer harness.

Chungus narrowed his eyes. He pointed a massive, fluffy finger.

"Spy!" Chungus bellowed.

The "elf" froze. With a puff of smoke, his disguise vanished, revealing a lanky man in a sharp red suit and a balaclava, holding a butterfly knife. The Spy from Team Fortress 2.

"Merde," the Spy snorted, flicking his cigarette ash onto a toy train. "I was paid handsomely by the Grineer to delay your departure, fat man. You’ll never figure out the code to the—"

"Enough talk!" Hildibrand yelled, trying to tackle the spy and instead suplexing the Murder Chair.

Captain Vor’s hologram laughed. "You are running out of time! The Janus Key to Christmas is mine!"

The escape room puzzles were getting intricate. Lasers appeared. Math equations appeared on the walls. The Elder Scrolls guards were still trying to sit down, their bodies contorted into impossible shapes.

Santa Chungus realized that standard logic wouldn't work. This required Chungus logic.

He stepped into the center of the room. He took a deep breath. The air rushed into his lungs, a roaring sound like a vacuum cleaner the size of a skyscraper.

Chungus began to expand.

He grew. And grew. His jolly rotundity pressed outwards. His soft, plush sides pushed against the glitching guards, gently shoving them back into normal reality. He expanded past Hildibrand, who gave a thumbs up as he was pressed against a wall.

Vinny looked up from his monitor, his eyes wide. "Chat. Chat, he's getting bigger. The hitbox is expanding. What is happening?"

Chungus became so overwhelmingly big, so incredibly dense with cheer, that the very reality of the escape room began to buckle. The lasers hit his fur and turned into candy canes. The complex math equations on the wall rearranged themselves to just read "BIG CHUNGUS FUNNY."

Captain Vor’s hologram flickered wildly. "No! This is impossible! The impurity of your mass is disrupting the Void energy!"

With a final, earth-shattering "HO HO HO," Santa Chungus expanded one last time.

The pressure was too great. The blast doors didn't just open; they popped off their hinges like corks from a champagne bottle. The lockdown sirens shattered. The Spy was launched out of a chimney stack.

The cold, fresh air of the North Pole rushed in.

Santa Chungus deflated back to his standard, merely gigantic size. He dusted off his velvet suit.

"Game over," Chungus stated simply.

He waddled to the sleigh, stepping over the wreckage of the escape room traps. Gauss was already in the front seat, vibrating with excitement to pull the sleigh at Mach 5.

Chungus turned back to the chaotic workshop. Hildibrand was striking a victory pose on top of the defeated Murder Chair. The Elder Scrolls guards had finally managed to sit down simultaneously and were staring ahead blankly. Vinny was ending his stream.

"Alright chat, I'm done. That was... something. Thanks for the bits. I need lie down."

Santa Chungus climbed into the sleigh. He cracked the reins, and with a burst of magic and speedster energy, the sleigh launched into the starry night sky.

As they flew over the glittering world below, Chungus looked down, a massive, knowing grin on his face. It was a weird Christmas, a chaotic Christmas. But it was a Chungus Christmas. And that made it perfect.
